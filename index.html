           <p></div>
                   The Yankees' minor league system is flourishing with young talent, but only a few of the Yankees' current prospects will make an impact for the Yankees or another team in the future. Most of the current top Yankees talent that carried them to the postseason in 2017 and 2018 including <a href=”https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/judgeaa01.shtml”>Aaron Judge</a> and <a href=”https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/severlu01.shtml”>Luis Severino</a> were drafted or signed and developed through the Yankees’ farm system. Some of the greatest modern Yankees such as <a href=”https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/jeterde01.shtml”>Derek Jeter</a> and <a href=”https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/riverma01.shtml”>Mariano Rivera</a> were built by the same farm system the new guys are coming up in. It is important to project how each of these players will perform in the big leagues to understand the Yankees’ assets and future needs at each position and, especially with the Yankees who are not afraid to make a big deal, the Yankees’ trade leverage when they own disposable depth.
